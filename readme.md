## 🧬 Project Overview

This project analyzes an ovarian single-cell RNA-seq dataset to explore **transcriptional transitions** from immune to proliferative cell states using Seurat and Monocle.

**Pipeline Summary**
1. **Quality Control (QC)** – Filtering low-quality cells by mitochondrial %, feature count, and outliers.  
2. **Normalization & PCA** – Feature scaling, HVG selection, PCA, and elbow analysis.  
3. **Clustering & UMAP** – Dimensional reduction and visualization of major cell populations.  
4. **Marker Identification** – Differential gene expression to identify top cluster markers.  
5. **Annotation & Integration** – Annotating cell types and aligning with known immune and proliferative markers.  
6. **Pseudotime Trajectory (Monocle 3)** – Ordering cells along differentiation trajectories.  
7. **Enrichment & PPI (STRING)** – GO/KEGG enrichment and network-level validation.

## 🧪 Key Results

- **Immune → Proliferative Transition:**  
  Early pseudotime regions enriched for immune-related TFs (e.g., *BATF*, *XCL1*, *CCL5*), later regions showed proliferative TFs (*E2F8*, *FOXA2*, *MYBL2*).  

- **Enrichment Patterns:**  
  - Early trajectory → cytokine signaling, immune activation pathways.  
  - Late trajectory → cell-cycle, hypoxia, and DNA repair pathways.  

- **STRING Network Insight:**  
  *FOXA2–E2F8–MYBL2* network acts as a central proliferative hub.

## 🎓 Hypothesis

> Ovarian single-cell transcriptomes show a **sequential transcriptional reprogramming** from immune-primed to proliferative states.  
> This shift likely represents tumor progression from immune activation toward sustained proliferation, consistent with the enriched cytokine-to-cell-cycle axis.
